\section{Introduction}
\label{Intro}
This report is the result of a smaller project to implement the A-star (A*) algorithm in a chase between two automated agents in a game world for the Game Engines, E2013 course at IT-University of Copenhagen.

The constraints of the project were: Agent A (the chasing agent) must use the A* algorithm to calculate a path to Agent B. Agent B must escape from agent A by moving according to a finite state machine. The agents must move in a grid world where some grids are passable and others are impassable. The chase must be displayed visually.

I have implemented the project in C\# based loosely on A* pseudo code by Rajiv Eranki\footnote{http://web.mit.edu/eranki/www/tutorials/search/}. The visual representation of the chase is displayed in the console.

I have worked with Jacob Grooss (jcgr@itu.dk) on some parts of this project (drawing of the map and parts of the movement for the fleeing agent).
