\section{Conclusion}
The project successfully implements the A* algorithm and the chase between the two agents. There is impassable terrain for agent A and agent B only moves when he is alerted to agent As presence. The chase could be in improved primarily in two different ways. 
\\One would be to make the fleeing agent more dynamic/smarter in his movement (not just straight away) and make agent B unable to go through impassable terrain.
\\Second would be to make the agents move one step of their path per simulation step (instead of their entire speed). This would make the movement speeds more evident in the simulation, but it is trickier to implement.

\subsection{Future work}
Other than the improvements mentioned above, I would change my A* implementation to be more flexible in its choice in distance calculation (instead of just Euclidean). Additionally I would rewrite the algorithms approach to nodes so that new ones are generated (making it more efficient for large map sizes).
