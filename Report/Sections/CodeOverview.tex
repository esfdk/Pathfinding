\section{Overview of the Program}
The game world is constructed from a two-dimensional array of \textbf{Node}s. A \textbf{Node} contains information about its x/y location, its parent and its cost. The cost of the node is how many "movement points" agent A must spend to move into the node (cost -1 means the node is impassable). Agent B can move freely around the game world.

After initialization of the game world and the agents, the map is drawn. Then agent B and agent A move until agent A occupies the same position as agent B. Agent B moves first in every iteration. If the Euclidean distance between agent A and agent B is less than twice the speed of agent A, agent B moves up to his own speed directly away from agent A.

After agent B has moved, agent A calculates a path to agent B using the A* algorithm. My implementation of the A* algorithm uses the game map as the nodes (as opposed to generating new ones as neighbours/successors) and thus is not suited for two units moving simultaneous.  My implementation is also a bit slow for very, very large maps as every node must have their parent reset before a run of the algorithm.
