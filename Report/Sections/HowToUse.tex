\section{How To Use}
Running the Pathfinding.exe opens a console window asking for size of the game world, position of the two agents and their speed. The program automatically sets approximately 10\% of the terrain to be impassable. After initialisation is done, the first map is drawn. Pressing the \textit{Enter} key continues the simulation. If agent A catches agent B, the simulation ends.
